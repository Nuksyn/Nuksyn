# Hi there, I'm Nikola 👋

### 🚀 Technical Support Specialist | Debugging & Automation
I specialize in troubleshooting high-load cloud environments, focusing on identifying why servers are struggling and taking the necessary actions to restore stability. I bridge the gap between support and development by diving into code-level issues to find root causes.

---

### 💻 What I Do
- **High-Load Troubleshooting:** Identifying and killing resource-heavy processes to prevent server crashes and maintain uptime.
- **Log Analysis & Debugging:** Investigating Nginx and Apache access logs to pinpoint traffic spikes or poorly optimized code.
- **Full-Stack Debugging:** Going beyond standard support by debugging PHP and Java issues that cause performance bottlenecks.
- **Workflow Automation:** Building Python and Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks, like domain information scraping and data gathering.

### Going forward:
- **Goal:** To move further into automation and technical problem-solving roles.
- **Fun Fact:** If a task takes me 5 minutes and I have to do it every day, I’ll spend 2 hours writing a script to make it take 5 seconds.
